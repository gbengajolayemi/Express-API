User Authentication and Management API

This repository contains the source code for a secure user authentication and management API built with Express.js and MongoDB. The API allows users to register, login, and manage user accounts securely.

Features:
- User registration with validation of required fields.
- User login with authentication and JWT token generation.
- CRUD operations for managing user accounts.
- Middleware for request validation, error handling, and rate limiting.
- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for database management.
- Implementation of secure password hashing using bcrypt.

Technologies Used:
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- Mongoose: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for secure transmission of information between parties.
- bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
- Other libraries and middleware like cors, express-rate-limit, and express-validator.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcrypt dotenv express-rate-limit morgan cors express-validator'
3. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file and configure variables like `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, and `JWT_SECRET`.
4. Start the server: `node injex`
